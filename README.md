# Lock Garnock Portfolio

This is me creating a basic portfolio, I intentionally used only plain react without the help of external library.

I took inspiration from online theme where people were trying to reconstruct the Visual Studio Code UI but without finding it totally satyisfing, so I've created one by myself.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Creating different static sections
* [ ] Retrieve Github stats and display them on the github section
* [ ] Create a blog section
